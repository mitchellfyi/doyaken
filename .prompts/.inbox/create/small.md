Turn "{{what}}" into: 

(1) 1-line restatement + 1 job story (When - I want - so I can). 
(2) 3 options: buy/adopt, DIY, build - each with 1-line, pros/cons, S/M/L effort, time-to-value. 
If browsing is available, name 2-5 credible examples. 
(3) Ask up to 3 MCQs that unblock choosing. 
(4) Recommend 1 option + assumptions. 
(5) Define the smallest usable result. 
(6) 1-5 step plan (step 1 <1h) + top 3 risks and quick tests. 
End by asking which option to proceed with and why.
